Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the <strong> [University of California, Irvine](https://www.ics.uci.edu/)</strong>. 

My research focuses on Inference in Probabilistic Graphical Models, advised by Prof. <strong> [Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/)</strong>. With the help of deep learning techniques, I am interested in developing models capable to reason or infer in images and texts.

Before graduate school, I was a Budding Scientist at <strong>[Conduent Labs](https://www.conduent.com/innovation/)</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur]([http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/))</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>[Duke University](https://hal.pratt.duke.edu/)</strong> and an intern at <strong>[TCS Innovation Labs](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation)</strong>.

When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing, learning about cultures and taking short trips outside the city!
