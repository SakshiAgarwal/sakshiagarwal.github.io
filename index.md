Hi! I am a final year PhD student at UC Irvine, where I'm affiliated with <strong> [Learning, Inference & Vision Group](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/group/)</strong> and advised by Prof. <strong> [Erik Sudderth](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/)</strong>. My PhD is generously supported by an [HPI](https://www.ics.uci.edu/hpi/) fellowship. I interned at [Amazon.com Services LLC](https://www.amazon.com/) in 2020. 

Broadly, my reesearch interests lie in machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. Through my research, I am passionate to improve the quality of human-AI interaction by building on foundational ideas like probabilistic modeling and optimization. My PhD thesis focuses on enhancing the reliability and robustness of image generative models like Diffusion Models, Hierarchical VAEs to retrieve images faithful to specific user constraints by adapting or aligning their latent representations. 

Before graduate school, I was a Budding Scientist at <strong>[Conduent Labs](https://www.conduent.com/innovation/)</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur]([http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/))</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>[Duke University](https://hal.pratt.duke.edu/)</strong> and an intern at <strong>[TCS Innovation Labs](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation)</strong>.

When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing, playing tennis, learning about cultures and taking short trips outside the city!
