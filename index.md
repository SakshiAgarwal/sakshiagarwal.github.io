Hi

I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the <strong> University of California, Irvine </strong>. I am currently exploring the field of graphical models, and my previous work includes using deep learning models in text understanding. Previously, I was a Budding Scientist at <strong> Conduent Labs</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). I received my bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>Duke University</strong> and an intern at <strong>TCS Innovation Labs</strong>. When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing and taking short trips outside the city!
