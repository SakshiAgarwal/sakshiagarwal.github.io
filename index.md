I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the <strong> [University of California, Irvine](https://www.ics.uci.edu/)</strong>. 

My research focuses on Inference in Probabilistic Graphical Models, advised by Prof.  <strong> [Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/)  </strong>  

I am currently exploring the field of reasoning in graphical models, and my previous work includes learning from text using deep learning models. 

Before graduate school, I was a Budding Scientist at <strong> Conduent Labs</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>Duke University</strong> and an intern at <strong>TCS Innovation Labs</strong>. When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing and taking short trips outside the city!
