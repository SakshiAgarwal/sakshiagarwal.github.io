Hi! I am a final year PhD student at UC Irvine, where I'm affiliated with <strong> [Learning, Inference & Vision Group](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/group/)</strong>. I'm incredibly fortunate to be advised by Prof. <strong> [Erik Sudderth](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/)</strong>. 

My interests focus on developing inference algorithms that leverage pre-trained Deep Generative Models (such as Diffusion Models) and Vision-Language Foundation Models (like BLIP, CoCa) to address real-world user queries involving both images and text. My goal is to adapt and align predictions of these foundational models to enhance their reliability and robustness in specific application contexts. During my PhD, I have developed variational inference algorithms for generative models like VAEs and diffusion models. I have applied such inference methods for various inverse problems like image inpainting, super-resolution and Deblurring. With recent developments in multimodal foundational models (like vision-language models), I am excited to align image generations (or captions) to user prompts (or complex scenes). In general, my goal is to adapt or align model predictions subject to certain user requirements or constraints.

Before graduate school, I was a Budding Scientist at <strong>[Conduent Labs](https://www.conduent.com/innovation/)</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur]([http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/))</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>[Duke University](https://hal.pratt.duke.edu/)</strong> and an intern at <strong>[TCS Innovation Labs](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation)</strong>.

When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing, playing tennis, learning about cultures and taking short trips outside the city!
