Hi! I am a final year PhD student at UC Irvine, where I'm affiliated with <strong> [Learning, Inference & Vision Group](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/group/)</strong>. I'm incredibly fortunate to be advised by Prof. <strong> [Erik Sudderth](https://ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/)</strong>. 

My research focuses on Inference in Deep Generative 


You can visit my google scholar profile [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uG2w1coAAAAJ). I am interested in developing inference methods on top of deep generative models, which enables reasoning or infering capabilities for images and texts.

Before graduate school, I was a Budding Scientist at <strong>[Conduent Labs](https://www.conduent.com/innovation/)</strong> (formerly known as Xerox Research Centre India). I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering (Instrumentation) with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from <strong> [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur]([http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/))</strong> in 2017. During that period, I was also a visiting researcher at <strong>[Duke University](https://hal.pratt.duke.edu/)</strong> and an intern at <strong>[TCS Innovation Labs](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation)</strong>.

When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, dancing, playing tennis, learning about cultures and taking short trips outside the city!
