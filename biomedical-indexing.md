I worked on <strong> Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)</strong> indexing for Biomedical Abstracts as part of my undergraduate thesis in the Department of Computer Science at <strong>IIT Kharagpur</strong>. 

Under the guidance of [Professor Sudeshna Sarkar](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sudeshna/), I successfully completed the tagging of biomedical abstract. Capturing the semantics of the abstract and using the representations for indexing was our major focus. You can refer to the [report](https://sakshiagarwal.github.io/BTPReport.pdf) for a detailed approach and experimentation. I was surprised how well RNNs captured the semantic relations in Biomedical text!

Some of the MeSH tags are : 

```
Sideroblastic, Congenital Nonspherocytic, Immobilized, Cultured, Chromium Isotopes, Abnormal, 
European Continental Ancestry Group, Glucose Oxidase, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, 
Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Glutathione, Heinz Bodies, Hematocrit, Abnormal, Humans, 
Hydrogen Peroxide, Infection, Mononuclear, Methemoglobin, Methods, Oxygen Consumption, Phagocytosis, 
Time Factors, Transaminases
```
